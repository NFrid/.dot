[Intro]
Dead Beats, lurking now, Dead Beats, lurking now
Dead Beats, lurking now, Dead Beats, lock it down

Dead Beats, lurking now, Dead Beats, lurking now
Dead Beats, lurking now, Dead Beats, lock it down

Dead Beats, lurking now, Dead Beats, lurking now
Dead Beats, lurking now, Dead Beats, lock it down
(This song makes no sense)

[Verse 1]
Gettin' kinda "stir-crazy," you heard this
I wonder what the meaning of "lazy" or life without work is
Kawaii shinigami at your service
Mark your enemies, and I'll show them what hurt is!!!
Merciless, but what else should I be?
Sudden nice-guy gap, but that's honesty
A blood price to be paid, but I promise- it's worth this
On-demand-homicidal-circus!!!
All ya really gotta do is sign on the dotted line~
It's probably fine, right...? Sike!! Your soul is mine~
It's all good, being a Dead Beat's got benefits
We'll be "best friends," that's the end of it
Then I get a rush of adrenaline, I think I like you...!
Wanna feel my 5-foot scythe inside you~
I would die for you!!! And that adorable scream...
Curious... would you ~die~ for me?

[Chorus]
We'll lock it down!!!
So when you bitches need me, call!!!
(By your side with my scythe and red wine~)
I'll make 'em wish they never lived at all!!!
(I'll fuck 'em up, Gucci?)
Just leave it all to us, 'cause in the end
We on another level, when the dust settles:
An actual scene outta hell

We'll lock it down!!!
So when you bitches need me, call!!!
(By your side with my scythe and red wine~)
I'll make 'em wish they never lived at all!!!
(I'll fuck 'em up, Gucci?)
Just leave it all to us, 'cause in the end
Not a lot that opposers can say
To counterpoint the wise ass words of my sensei:
("Skip class")
... Okay, next?
("Get ripped")
... Eh, thought so

[Verse 2]
Make no mistake, these are "killer vibes"
I don't "take breaks" 'cause I'm taking lives!
To die by the scythe? It's the highest honor!
Run and hide?! You can try... you're a goddamn goner
I could play the game by the rules, hell, I'd lose it
Drop names, drain fools dry, I'm ruthless!!
Grab a little auto-tune, then abuse it
2-clicks "beep-boop" sounds like music!!!
New hits, cheap loops, samples, free beats
Loose fit, shit design like a pair of Yeezys
Rapping's easy, music's hard!
Slapping fair-use material together, I could never be
The star I seek to be, swear I'll make ya proud
Dead Beats cheer for me, and cheer loud!
Decimate the crowd, that's for sure~
... Got a little sentimental, back to murder!!!

[Chorus]
We'll lock it down!!!
So when you bitches need me, call!!!
(By your side with my scythe and red wine~)
I'll make 'em wish they never lived at all!!!
(I'll fuck 'em up, Gucci?)
Just leave it all to us, 'cause in the end
We on another level, when the dust settles:
An actual scene outta hell

We'll lock it down!!!
So when you bitches need me, call!!!
(By your side with my scythe and red wine~)
I'll make 'em wish they never lived at all!!!
(I'll fuck 'em up, Gucci?)
Just leave it all to us, 'cause in the end
Just leave it, just leave it
Just leave it all to us

[Outro]
Calliope Mori on this goddamn mic
I don't want your fuckin' money, I just want your life
I'm filling syllables with curse words, because I am an amateur
Everybody likes... self-depreciating... rap...

... I'm gonna stop. Like, I got nothing. I'm... I'm so tired man. I'm so tired. "Don't quit your reapin' job." Got 'em

Dead Beats, lurking now, Dead Beats, lurking now
Dead Beats, jerk it now!!! Dead Beats, jerk it now!!!
(Yo yo YO YO YO STOP!!! Stop. That is so inappropriate.)
What, I don't get it...? "Jerking," like... do a jerky dance, yeah?
Jerk to the left~
Jerk to the right~
(Dude, just stop talking.)
Okay
