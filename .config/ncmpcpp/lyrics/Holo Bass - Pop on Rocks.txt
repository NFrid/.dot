[Intro]
Take it slowly, this book is dangerous
Ready?

[Chorus]
Knox in box
Fox in socks
Knox on fox in socks in box
Socks on Knox and Knox in box
Fox in socks on box on knox
Chicks with bricks come
Chicks with blocks come
Chicks with bricks and blocks and clocks come
Let's do tricks with bricks and blocks, sir
Let’s do tricks with chicks and clocks sir

[Verse 1]
First I'll make a quick trick brick stack. (Brick stack?)
Then I'll make a quick trick block stack. (Block stack)
You can make a quick trick chick stack
You can make a quick trick clock stack (look sir, Mr. Knox sir.)
And here’s a new trick, Mr. Knox
Socks on chicks and chicks on fox
Fox on clocks on bricks and blocks
Bricks and blocks on Knox on box
Now we come to ticks and tocks, sir
Try to say this Mr. Knox, sir
Clocks on fox tick
Clocks on fox tock
Six sick
Bricks tick
Six sick
Chicks tock

[Verse 2]
Please, sir
I don't like this trick, sir
My tongue isn't quick or slick, sir
I get all those ticks and clocks, sir
Mixed up with the chicks and tocks, sir
I can't do it, Mr. Fox, sir
I'm so sorry, Mr. Knox, sir
Here's an easy game to play
Here's an easy thing to say
New socks
Two socks
Whose socks?
Sue's socks
Who sews whose socks?
Sue sews Sue’s socks
Who sees who sews whose new socks, sir?
That’s not easy Mr. Fox, sir

[Verse 3]
Who comes? Crow comes Joe slow crow comes (God damn it!)
Who sews crow's clothes?
Sue sews Crow’s clothes. (That one's hard.)
Sue sews socks of fox in socks now
Slow Joe Crow sews knox in box now. (Uhh?...)

[Chorus]
Knox in box
Fox in socks
Knox on fox in socks in box
Socks on Knox and Knox in box
Fox in socks on box on knox
Chicks with bricks come
Chicks with blocks come
Chicks with bricks and blocks and clocks come
Let's do tricks with bricks and blocks, sir
Let's do tricks with chicks and clocks sir

[Outro]
Mr. Knox sir, what a shame sir
This is real! It’s real!
I'm not gonna finish it; it's too long
It's like really long. It goes on for like, a little bit
