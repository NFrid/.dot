[Intro]
I came along for the ride
You’re wicked with the clutch
Happened so fast and it hurt so much
You're a car crash
And I can't look away
I should have known by now
I'm still not afraid
I do it to myself
Love is what I never say
You're a car crash
And I can't look away

[Pre-Chorus]
All I see is shattered glass and
Red lights passing
My life flashing
Headed for the same disaster
Faster and faster and faster

[Chorus]
I couldn't stop at the red light
Stop at the red light
I couldn't stop at the red light
You're a car crash
And I can't look away

[Verse 1]
I came along for the ride
You’re wicked with the clutch
Happened so fast and it hurt so much
You're a car crash
And I can't look away

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I see is shattered glass and
Red lights passing
My life flashing
Headed for the same disaster
Faster and faster and faster

[Chorus]
I couldn't stop at the red light
The red light
Stop at the red light
I couldn't stop at the red light
You're just like a car crash
And I can't look away
From the headlights
The red light
Stop at the red light
I couldn't stop at the red light
You're just like a car crash
And I can't look away!

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I see is shattered glass and
Red lights passing
(Let's go for a ride!)
Headed for the same disaster
Faster and faster and faster

[Chorus]
I couldn't stop at the red light
The red light
Stop at the red light
I couldn't stop at the red light
You're just like a car crash
And I can't look away
From the headlights
The red light
Stop at the red light
I couldn't stop at the red light
You're just like a car crash
Like a car crash!
And I can't look away!
