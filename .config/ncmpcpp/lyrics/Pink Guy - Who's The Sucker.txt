Who's the sucker mane, who's the sucker mane? [x4]

When I was younger
I used to play with play dough
Now that I'm older
I still play with play dough
We go play basketball in the park
My skin is darker than tree bark
Just when you thought
We couldn't get any nicer
We go around the place
Looking for that verginer
Right when we were about to go to bed
This sucker came up and he started to said

Who the sucker mane, who the sucker mane? [x4]

Back in the hood they call me Salamander
Now look at me, they call me David
Dirty David, so oh please
Hop off my swag and choke on these nuts
I run away from police
Like macaroni
I'm holding my scrotum
I used to drink vegetable juice and then I vomit
So I drink fruit juice and I vomit
I once found a dead dog on the road
I left him there on the road
You want to know why? because we stir-fry
He came up and we started to said

Who the sucker mane, who the sucker mane? [x4]

No? OK
