Konnichiwa, senpai
Please notice me
I watch Asian cartoons
I'm a weeaboo

I live in my mom's house
I'm like 32
I collect swords and throwing stars
'Cause I'm a weeaboo

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But I will always be one step ahead of you
Because I read the manga
(You're such a fucking pleb, are you even even Japanese bro?)

I haven't showered in like 16 weeks
All my friends and peers are ashamed of me
'Cause all of a sudden
I think I'm Japanese

Yes, I'm a weeaboo
Yes, I'm a weeaboo
Yes, I'm a weeaboo
Yes, I'm a weeaboo
A filthy weeaboo
(Naruto's so overrated)
A dirty weeaboo
(You wanna see my katana collection?)
A fucking weeaboo
(I'm learning Japanese on Rosetta Stone)
A disgusting weeaboo
(So I'm like basically Japanese now)

I live at my computer desk
And argue with teenagers on the internet
About atheism
And how Japan is superior to other countries
I learned a bit of Japanese
So now I'm qualified to be a part of their community
So I made my avatar a kawaii waifu

Yes, I'm a weeaboo
(Uh duh, everybody wears kimonos)
Yes, I'm a weeaboo
(Ninjas are still real, okay?)
Yes, I'm a weeaboo
(Uh, k-konnichiwa)
Yes, I'm a weeaboo
(Yeah, domo arigato)
A filthy weeaboo

A dirty weeaboo
A fucking weeaboo
A disgusting weeaboo
