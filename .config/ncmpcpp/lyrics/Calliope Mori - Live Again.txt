[Verse 1]
"おつカリ! " It's the end of the party, let's hit the road
Before I have to flash back to 死神モード
死ぬほど忙しくて, gotta run
But thanks for watching what I put out, though it's not a ton (感謝!)
Excuse me, sorry, 大変, time to say goodbye again
Promise it's a matter of time before we're best friends!
It's not the end of your 森
'Cause every closed door is just the intro of a brand new story!

One wish
That I can't pretend I don't wanna see come true
I know it wouldn't make a difference
If you thought of me as much as I think about you...
But maybe it's deliverance?
From the pain I know is coming on when my old soul's finally gone
It's not wrong to think about it, but I'll stop for tonight
'Cause we're immortalized forever in the songs that we write, ya know?

[Chorus]
そろそろ Say Goodbye, "The End"
I'm not sorry, but I wanna see you again sometime
A song in my heart, a world of worry falling on your mind
Why don't we leave it all behind?
この瞬間が宝物
君たちとあたし、いつまでも
「今日も生きてよかった」
と言ったら、幸せ

[Verse 2]
Close your eyes for a minute, and envision a place
Where everybody's cherishing life in one same space
And it's embarrassing to say, 'cause you're the one that I chase
But see, mortality's what makes a life sweeter to taste, right?
Fatalities, fallacies, sweet and sour, simmer, freeze
Time with me and you, refreshing like a haunted breeze
Honestly, it's messing with the Reaper mentality
Sleeping on the fact that history has told me how to be

Do I despise human life? Something really I ain't thought of
But I die inside a little when we say "じゃあ、また"
人間の感情は不要、邪魔だ
Even so, まだまだ　真実バタバタ
It's not enough just to see you every "once in a while"
Searching in the darkness of my world for a smile—there's you!
また明日と明後日、
私たちの手、きっと重ねる

[Chorus]
そろそろ Say Goodbye, "The End"
I'm not sorry, but I wanna see you again sometime
A song in my heart, a world of worry falling on your mind
Why don't we leave it all behind?
この瞬間が宝物
君たちとあたし、いつまでも
「今日も生きてよかった」
と言ったら、幸せ

[Break]
そろそろ Say Goodbye...
See you again, sometime
Ladada...
この瞬間が宝物
君たちとあたし、いつまでも
「今日も生きてよかった」
…マジよかった

[Chorus]
そろそろ Say Goodbye, "The End"
I'm not sorry, but I wanna see you again sometime
A song in my heart, a world of worry falling on your mind
Why don't we leave it all behind?
この瞬間が宝物
君たちとあたし、いつまでも
「今日も生きてよかった」
と言ったら、幸せ

そろそろ Say Goodbye
Ladada see you again, sometime
A song in my heart
この瞬間が宝物
「また君に会いたい」
と言ったら、幸せ
