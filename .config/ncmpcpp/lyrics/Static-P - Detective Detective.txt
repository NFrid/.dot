[Verse 1]
Woke up can't see
Hands: cuffed. Tied feet
I don't know how I got here

Uh! The ground was shaking like the string on a bass!
Smell perfume, cigars
And wines. (Run!)

From the sounds in the room
One could tell there were two
Watching me as I pretended to sleep

And when that thing took off
I just let my body roll
To the doors of that limousine!

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh! I am Detective Detective
Deducing devious deeds
Don't dare you dabble in darkness
Or I'll devise your defeat

[Chorus]
If you run and hide I will fine you
I am deep in your mind
You haven't figured it out;
I'm predicting your moves!

Just when you think you've one-upped me
I am two steps in front
See this is my special move:
I put myself in your shoe

(Detective Detective, do tell us how you solved the crime
Did you deceive them deducing darkness in disguise?)

(Hold up!)

[Verse 2]
Back track. I made my escape
But with that bag on my head
I never saw a face

So I removed the bag
Untied my legs
Realized I was still inside their base

I saw the limo
Comin' back!
I kept cool and decided to stay and chat

[Pre Chorus 2]
"Gentlemen, please,there's no need to attack
Quite simply, I was startled. I will go where you ask
Keep covered, your faces, I have no reason to see
I only ask we treat each other politely."

[Chorus 2]
If you run and hide I will fine you
I am deep in your mind
You haven't figured it out;
I'm predicting your moves!

Just when you think you've one-upped me
I am two steps in front
See this is my special move:
I put myself in your shoe

I am Detective Detective
I'm on the case!
Master of human interactions
A friendly face!

(Hmhmahahahaha. Yeah~
Detective Detective, do tell us how you solved the crime
Did you deceive them deducing darkness in disguse?
I dare say, Detective
It seems as though you're reading minds
Can you read them?
Eh-What?)

[Verse 3]
I continue:
The two men in suits were sittin' lookin' pretty tough
With their hands on their sides
Like they're about to pull their guns
Think I know where they came from
Judging by their demeanor
Think I know where we're going
From the fact that I'm not dead, yet!

Dropped off
Two blocks from my house
A block from the bank
Where something strange was going down

Just as expected
It was the scene of a crime
It's been over an hour
Since the cops had arrived

I asked around
The only evidence:
One rock thrown through the window and a hair clip
One pointed out that on his way in
He saw my limo
Yes, that was my limo

[Bridge]
Pushed up my glasses and gave a little smirk
When people speak I listen to the thoughts behind their words
"In a short while-", I said to them out loud
"There will be another robbery, to which more officers are bound."

(*Ksh* There's been another break-in. Kerwits-Bank on Main.)

Don't worry, though, it's just a ploy
Their alibi, you'd say

One culprit is among us
The rest: at that bank
And inside one of your cop cars, here
You'll find the money's safe

[Chorus 3]
If you run and hide I will fine you
I am deep in your mind
You haven't figured it out;
I'm predicting your moves!

Just when you think you've one-upped me
I am two steps in front
See this is my special move:
I put myself in your shoe

(Oooooo~)
Run and hide I will fine you
I am deep in your mind
You haven't figured it out;
I'm predicting your moves! (Moooves~)

Just when you think you've one-upped me
I am two steps in front. (Oh-o-ou-uh-ah-OW!)
See this is my special move:
I put myself in your shoe (Yeah~)

I am Detective Detective
I'm on the case!
Master of human interactions
A friendly face!

[Outro]
Detective Detective:
Out
