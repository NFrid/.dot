[Intro]
ああ、おはようございます。
今日は、チャーハンを作ります。
フライドライスをですね？
さて、はじめましょう！

[Verse]
Fried rice, fri-fri-fried rice bitch
You wanna play your cards with God and roll the dice, bitch
Weeding out the weak with agriculture education
Oh, you got me eating seeds and I ain't talking bout fellatio
I'm crazy, yo, got that technique stir fry chopstick asian flow
I ain't about the oven or the microwave grills
But I know a little bit about the culinary skills
Required, if you wanna roll with the frying pan
Gotta fry with the heart of a China man
Anybody got another method in the pantry can suck my dick
This shit tastes like vagina man
Now I ain't no Gordon Ramsay, but I make the best damn rice you pansies
A bitch like me came from Japan, see
Coin slot eyes gonna drop the panties
If you want a piece of this get in line, you piece of shit
They just keep coming back for more you'd think Jehovah's Witnesses
They call me the grain man, ancient ritual praying can
Help cook rice on a spiritual level for those willing and able to be the king of the table, heh
Have some of my grain and I ain't talking about the fucking headaches you get on the morning after Fridays
I throw this rice like bridesmaids

[Outro]
Stir fry, stir fry
Stir fry, stir fry
Stir fry (motherfucker), stir fry
Stir fry, stir fry
Chin Chin, Chin Chin
Chin Chin, Chin Chin
Chin Chin, Chin Chin
