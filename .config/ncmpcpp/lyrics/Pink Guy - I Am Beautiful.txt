[Intro]
Don't look at me, don't look at me
Don't look at me, don't look at me

[Verse 1]
Every day is so wonderful
Then suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain, I'm so ashamed

[Pre-Chorus]
I am beautiful, no matter what they say

[Chorus]
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down... oh no...
So don't you bring me down today
