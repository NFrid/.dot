[Detective]
I was sitting in the club room with Hareka
When in walked the teacher
He took a few steps and then froze
Startled with is eyes glued to mine
"The chase."

He-e-e-e - took off running
He-e-e-e - He got no backbone
He-e-e-e - Knows I know something
He fled out that club room door

I looked outside
Three stories high, no sweat no sweat
Fear struck her eyes as I jumped

Swing, baby, swing
Why don't you kick that dust off the top of your feet and swing
Baby, one more time for me
Wa-oh-oh
Swing, baby, swing
Why don't you kick that dust off the top of your feet and swing
Baby, one more time for me

(Wa-oh-oh-oh)
Look out below-oh-oh
(Wa-oh-oh-oh)
Baby
(Wa-oh-oh-oh)
Here I come(I-I-go-oh)
Jumpin' out the window
(I-I-go-oh)
Tumbling off a canopy
(I-I-go-oh-oh-oh)
Sliding down the drain pipe
You cannot run. You cannot hide

Pulled out my gun
I've got this one. No sweat. No sweat
Stared up at Hareka and called her phone

Swing, baby, swing
Why don't you kick that dust off the top of your feet and swing
Baby, one more time for me
Wa-oh-oh
Swing, baby, swing
Why don't you kick that dust off the top of your feet and swing
Baby, one more time for me

Ring-Ring Hareka
We're gonna catch this guy but
Please be my second pair of eyes
I am hiding out
Behind this bush so tell me
When you see him come outside
Click, clack someones feet
Come rushing right towards me
Say, Hareka, is this our guy?
Tick, tock! Hareka
I heard you hold your breath so
I will assume that now's our time
Get up and sing it
Just get up and sing it, baby
I know that you've got the bomb on your mind
But you've got to let it come out from inside
Oh no no no
Sing, Hareka!
Why don't you get those thoughts
Off of your chest
And let me take good care of you

[Detective]
Freeze!

[Hareka]
No! Don't!
It wasn't him. It was- me
I- I brought the bomb in
I was told that if I didn't take it in my parents-

[Detective]
Shh. Don't worry. I already know
We'll catch 'em when we can
As for right now - squirt tag - would you like to play?

Swing, baby, swing
Why don't you kick that dust off the top of your feet and swing
Baby, one more time for me
Wa-oh-oh
Swing, baby, swing
Why don't you kick that dust off the top of your feet and swing
Baby, one more time for me
