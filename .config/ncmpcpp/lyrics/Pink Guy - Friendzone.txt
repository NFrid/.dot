Do you know why you're lonely?
It's 'cause you're fat... and gay

Girls don't choose the nice guys
And you're a nice guy!
But you're fat...
... and you're fucking gay

And why don't girls see the inside?
Oh, they do!
And they see
That you're still fat and gay

There's no such thing as the
Friendzone!
Friendzone! (Oh-oh)
The only reason that you're lonely
Is 'cause you're fat and gay

There's no such thing as the
Friendzone!
Friendzone! (Oh-oh)
The only reason that you're lonely
Is 'cause you're fat and gay
