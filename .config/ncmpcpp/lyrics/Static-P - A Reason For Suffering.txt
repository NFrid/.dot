[Intro: Aoke & Hareka]
We've had it rough since we got started (Uh-oh)
And don't we all just want to thrive
In a warm and loving place?
We dreamed, we sang, we swore forever
But now our hearts have worn
We didn't ask for war

[Interlude: Aoke]
(This is not the end)
(This is not the end)
This is not the end!
This is not the end!

[Verse 1: Aoke & Bee]
When we started up this idol group, two years ago
Our songs were mocked if not ignored (And the names that they called us, oh!)
We should have known that we would have our rivals (Uh-uh-oh)
And, by our rivals fans
[Aoke & Keiko] We were dragged through someone’s spit on the floor

[Pre-Chorus 1: Aoke]
Sometimes it hurts so bad that I don't want to get up so

[Chorus: Aoke]
Build, in us, a dream
That's worth great suffering
That a heart might come to grow
And that that has some sort of meaning
Make for us a journey
That's worth crying for
That a heart might come to know
That it is valued and adored

[Bridge 1: Aoke]
This is not the end
This is not the end
This is not the end
Keep singing
This is not the end
Start up the second year
Two members quit, right here
But I don't blame them with no fans to show

[Verse 2: Aoke & Keiko]
Then it happened: something that we can't explain (Uwah-uh-a-ah)
Offered a gig that led to fame!
They were chanting our names and we were finally idolized
We were voted to perform on the Top Ten Idol stage

[Pre-Chorus 2: Aoke]
Finally all our hard hard work started to pay off so

[Chorus: Aoke]
Build, in us, a dream
That's worth great suffering
That a heart might come to grow
And that that has some sort of meaning
Make for us a journey
That's worth crying for
That a heart might come to know
That it is valued and adored

[Post-Chorus: Aoke]
I guess I'm trying to say that I've come to believe
That this life's not meant to be easy
Like there's a reason for our suffering
Like there's a reason we should chase these dreams
I guess I'm trying to say that I've come to believe
That pain is, ultimately, there
To show us value
To show it's worth us being here

[Bridge 2: Aoke]
Now, back to the story
Yeah, it gets a little dark, from here
I remind you all
This is not the end. This is not the end
When the bomb went off, back stage
We were sitting pretty far away
The bomb was hidden in our baggage
And the world wanted someone to blame
Everyone pointed right at us
But we were framed, we didn't cause their pain
We lost all our loving fans
And that love had turned to hate
And now we're here, on our third year
To give it one more shot to redeem our name
Some members left and that's okay
It's a pretty dark world, out there, today

[Verse 3: Keiko]
Every time we step into this place
This school, this nightmare of hate
We gotta put up with the wrongs
That we didn't create
I can't even count the days
Where all I want to do is sleep
[Keiko & Hareka] hold my pillow tight against my face
[Keiko & Hareka] while I scream and weep
I can't even count the times I've
[Keiko & Bee] seen someone spit in my food
I can't even count the times we've
[Keiko & Aoke]been pushed around, and bruised

[Breakdown: Hareka & Aoke]
I wish it all would go away
(Y'know I wish it all would go away)
I wish it all would go away
(Wish it all would go away)
[Hareka] (So – Please.)

[Chorus: Aoke & Hareka]
Build, in us, a dream
That's worth great suffering
That a heart might come to grow
And that that growth has some sort of meaning
Make for us a journey
That's worth crying for
That a heart might come to know
That it is valued and adored

[Post-Chorus: Aoke]
I guess I'm trying to say that I've come to believe
That this life's not meant to be easy
Like there's a reason for our suffering
Like there's a reason we should chase these dreams
I guess I'm trying to say that I've come to believe
That pain is, ultimately, there
To show us value
To show it's worth us being here
