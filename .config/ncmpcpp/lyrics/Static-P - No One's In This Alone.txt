Alright
So, today; It's my day off (heheh)
I'm just gonna go chill
Hah! Hah! Yeah! Woo!

[Verse 1]
My day. I'm out! Got nuttin' to do
A smirk on my face as I traverse the town
I go solo. Das just how I do
I have fun alone. That's what I'm used to

And, as I'm stepping through the crowd
Something quickly pulls me out
*gasp* Who is this?
What do they want with me?

Suddenly I realize, I was being dragged inside
Of the shop, by one of the Star Blush Girls

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So I spoke
"I don't know where we're goin' but I go alone."
Then she froze, and stepped close
And then she whispered to me: "Listen to me."

[Chorus 1]
No one's in this alone, I wanna do my part
You can't see it but they're fightin' for you
Everyone of us is a weakling on our own
So I'm learning, to trust, with you

No one, in this whole world, is in it alone
Who would think we're just to pleasure ourselves
So I'll fight for you and this whole wide world, too
As I'm learning, to trust with you

[Verse 2]
*sigh*

Her hand, gripped tight, I don't know what to do
I guess I forgot, what this felt like
We sat, we laughed, and we got us some food
I can't figure out, what, to act like

I want to try to be their friend, but all these thoughts are in my head
Mmm, 'No they don't, really care about you'
I gotta shake this from my mind, cause all these thoughts'll leave me blind
To the life, that the light, might bring

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know, and I know
That you want me to be your friend
And I hope, That I'll learn
That I'm strong enough to trust again

(What'd she say to me?)

[Chorus 2]
No one's in this alone, I wanna do my part
You can't see it but they're fightin' for you
Everyone of us is a weakling on our own
So I'm learning, to trust, with you

No one, in this whole world, is in it alone
Who would think we're just to pleasure ourselves
So I'll fight for you and this whole wide world, too
As I'm learning, to trust with you

[Verse 3]
So, fast-forward to the next day
While I was still not feeling sure of myself
In to the clubroom the detective came
He said "I'm hearing hopes that all will go well"

"Now, I know you know what others say
And I hope it never happens again
They say that you're the girls that bombed the stage...
So I'm your new club manager!" And, oh

Then my heart started screamin', like, "No!"
Cause I thought, I could trust you
Then my heart, went down
And my trust, went down

And it all went down, so I stood
And said...

[Chorus 3]
No one's in this alone, I wanna do my part
You can't see it but they're fightin' for you
Everyone of us is a weakling on our own
So I'm learning, to trust, with you

No one, in this whole world, is in it alone
Who would think we're just to pleasure ourselves
So I'll fight for you and this whole wide world, too
As I'm learning, to trust with you

[Outro]
Ooo, and then a tear came to her eye as I spoke
And I started to choke, 'cause I know
What I said, what it meant
We were starting, to trust, again

But still, I'm not sure
What I'm supposed to believe
I'm still, insecure
So be patient with me
