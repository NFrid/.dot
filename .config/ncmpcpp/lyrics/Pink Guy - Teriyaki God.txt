"Dream a while
Before it is time to go, go, go, go"...

Ladies and gentlemen, this is karaoke night (oh)
The only night that requires someone to hold me tight (oh)
To keep me back from these wack, withering fucks
When I spray them down, they're going to have more holes than hermaphrodites
Grab the mic, feel the bumps like a doctor might
Fuck a kind word to reduct the fight
I'm taking it all, boy, they say that I'm hogging the portions
Always back in your girl like a homesick abortion, like
This a story about a young boy, unemployed
Bastardized, coy looking fuck with the loudest noise
Run Versace, run Versace, run Versace
With a rubber band attached to your origami belt around my waist (what)
Hidden doors to black rap like the burqas
Off the market dirty black acts like a circus (what)

Like whoa

"Close your eyes
The music is soft and warm
Dream a while
Before it is time to go, go, go, go"...

(uh, yeah)
Motherfuckers want a piece of all the action
Running 'round in circles, the police will never catch us
Fucking with your boy can leave you running with the patches
And I guarantee you playing against the flame with some matches

"Close your eyes
The music is soft and warm
Dream a while
Before it is time to go"...

I've been here a long time
I've been here a long time
Let darkness take away the pain
(Breh)
How, can we heal the same?
(Skrrt)
How, can we feel the same?
