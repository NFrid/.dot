[Intro]
Sunshine. Day bright
No worries in her life
Just another passing day
To play
Walking the road
Spying wonders life can hold
When she sees a friendly face
What fate!

[Verse 1]
Smile on my face, I said "Hey
Will you come with me today
Judging auditions for a play?
What do you say?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Got in the car
And we took off, not too far
At an abandoned building, right in town, we parked

[Chorus]
When the world starts blurring tell me what do I do?
My heart is pumping
Gotta think fast, push this through
I was told to never stand still
When danger's coming gotta use the power of will

[Refrain]
Don't give up, don't let down
Stay calm. Be ready. Let's turn this all around
Don't give up and don't let down
Stay calm. Stay calm. Stay calm

[Verse 2]
So you want me to talk, oh
Reminisce about way back when
Detective Detective?

"Well, we can continue the story but... do let me say"

Funny that you'd visit me in jail and ask me why
'cause you know, and you know, don't you know?
I'd love to stay to chat and visit but my hands are tied
(Ooh~) Can't you open your eyes and see what came from my crimes?

[Verse 3]
Funny that you'd visit me in jail and ask me why (Ooh~)
Don't you already know, (Ooh~) Detective (Ooh~) Detective!? (Ooh~)
'cause honestly I'm not the only one that should be doing time (Ooh~)
But you already know, (Ooh~) Detective (Ooh~) Detective! (Ooh~)

[Pre-Chorus]
I tied her up in an abandoned building
I called her parents who were scared but willing
They came to pick her up for a little exchange

[Chorus]
When the world starts blurring tell me what do I do?
My heart is pumping. Gotta think fast, push this through
I was told to never stand still
When danger's coming— (Oh~)

[Refrain]
Don't give up, don't let down
Stay calm. Be ready. Let's turn this all around
Don't give up and don't let down
Stay calm. Stay calm. Stay calm

[Bridge]
Did I do it for money or did I do it for fame?
Tell me, Detective Detective, how are the girls these days?
I saw the news, in jail, that someone bombed their stage

[Pre-Chorus]
You turn around for just one minute and your plans go up in flames
That little girl was far too clever. Should have taken her phone away
She made a call from her pocket while I was tryin' to tie her and so they knew just where to be
Suddenly I'm sittin' there cornered with the cops on top of me (Ay~)

[Chorus]
When the world starts blurring tell me what do I do?
My heart is pumping. Gotta think fast, push this through
I was told not to never stand still
When danger's coming (Ooh~) gotta use the power of will

[Refrain]
Don't give up, don't let down
Stay calm. Be ready. Let's turn this all around
Don't give up and don't let down
Stay calm. Stay calm. Stay calm

Don't give up, don't let down
Stay calm. Be ready. Let's turn this all around
Don't give up and don't let down
Stay calm. Stay calm. Stay calm
