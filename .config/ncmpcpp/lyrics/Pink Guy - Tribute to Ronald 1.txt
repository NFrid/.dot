I got a story that'll waggle your eyes
I got a burger and a thingy of fries, I think we disguise
Our lives when we speak, but we show it with what we eat
We defeat eternal demons with heaps of internal shitty meat
Ronald had a dream when he was sucking his mom's titty
He wanted to palm cities, rockin' his fall hoodie
In this heat? Nah man, he ain't no clown
He don't need another guardian to hold the fucking place down
Ronald, I never got to say thank you
If you caught me at a KFC, I never meant to hurt you
I tore down a thousand Burger Kings for talking shit
Have 'em lost for words on some Stephen Hawking shit
This cancer's got these little kids biting lips
If burgers kill then fuck it, I'm gonna die from it
I'll fucking die for you Ronald, I hope you understand
Avoid beef and I'm taking your ass to Pakistan
See if Ronald McDonald would have to run a bottle shop
Ronald would unload a couple shots on these fucking cops
See McDonalds is the finest china quality
That make your legs wobble a lava lamp holding Socrates is
Less post modern than Ronald, 'cause in a thousand years
You and I'll be gone but the patties keep flipping
The chicken is still delicious, the living expense is limitless
So why the fuck you eating salad, bitch?
See back in '48 was when I heard of this magic place
When the atom bomb crushed a small country in it's natural state
Rebuilt itself into a fine little real estate
And reeled in any American chains with exceptional taste
But...

They don't understand...
They don't understand
Who you and I are
