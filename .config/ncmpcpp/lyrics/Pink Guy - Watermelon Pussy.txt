I eat pussy like I have a disease
And the antidote is inside the pussy
People don't like me cause I touch them
Mad pussy like Tom and Jerry
I eat pussy like I have diabe-tees
And the insulin is inside my pee-pee
Oh! Yes, you know this
I have a big staff like Moses
Alakazam and abracadabra
I go hard like viagra
If pussy was a vegetable...
I'd grow it
That pussy so good
That it's got me singing a little song and it goes like
(Sing/Auto-tune)
Gimme that puuuuuusssssssyyyyyyyyyyeeaaahh
Gimme that puss-ay
They call me the pussy man
They call me the pussy man
Oh pussy man
Where you gonna run to
They call me the pussy man
Pussy man
Pussy man
Pussy man
Pussy man where ya gonna run to?

Eat the pussy like a watermelon
Eat the pussy like a watermelon
Eat the pussy like a watermelon

Slurp, Slurp

Eat the pussy like a watermelon
Eat the pussy like a watermelon
Eat the pussy like a watermelon
Slurp, Slurp
