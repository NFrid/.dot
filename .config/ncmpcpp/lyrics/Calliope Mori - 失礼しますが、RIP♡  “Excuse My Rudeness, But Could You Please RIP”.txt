[Intro]
Everyone! Thanks for coming to today's tanoshii live-stream.
Today, I think I wanna rap. Well then, shall we begin?

Fuck it

[Verse 1]
Modern-day killers really must hate fun
More often, people takin' lives rockin' knives and guns
The real murder connoisseurs in the ruins of hell
Got used to luring the audience with moe that sells, 'cause
To my surprise, snatching' lives とりあえず禁止
Nice try, stoppin' the motherfuckin' Da Vinci
Of human erasure, can't stop the pace, sir
Make sure whеn "standing off" my rhymes slay first
Jealous haters out thеre, high-five! I see you
"No one's gonna buy this." Bitch, I believe you!
Cute as all hell, in a literal sense
A bitter pretense
But the views are all tell, no show, dollars and cents
Don't mean nada to the queen of "sayonara"
Scythe and other super radical toys to tear your heart
Apart at the seams, still the killer of your dreams!
Slip your soul into my pocket, then I flee the scene-
It’s like that

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If you take my advice, you'll be killed by what'cha don't know!
But the other saying that I like so much more
Is along the lines of "you reap what you fuckin' SEISO"
Gotta know, ain’t it so, could ya let go of your soul for me?
すごいDIE好き〜
I'm not asking for much: do me a favor and die?
ごめん、失礼しますが死んでください❤〜

[Chorus]
"Kill ‘em with the bass"
殺すの事がTANOSHII
(Teehee, bitch)
Murder is so fucking kawaii
（かわいい、ね！）
死神先生+Calliope!
Kill 'em with the bass, 'til we get 'em to say:
Alright! "YAY! 素敵な暗殺〜"
So it goes:

"Dead Beats, listen up!" It's what'cha want?
Me comin' in the night for ya!
勝手にやってる地獄で犯罪じゃないから~
Bass high enough to exterminate ya
You'll dance anyway, 'cause it's human nature
でも、その前何となく一緒に楽しもう〜
あなたの死ぬ日まで！

[Verse 2]
申し訳ないです、やりすぎました。
なんで敬語でラップしてる？ちょっと変だ。
Not what you expected? Better tell you straight-forward
Hear you all the way in hell, slamming on your keyboard
Go ahead and BE sore, but I won't run
'Cause I'm a workaholic business-lady getting shit done
Taking souls? Not an industry for suckers, for one
But it's a mistress of darkness's day in the sun~ (きもい...)
C A double L I O P E
I really love this fake-murder shit's eye-opening
Taking words I get right off the cuff, and script my own thing
"Murder with words ain't enough?" that was the past me! (Sorry~)
Gonna take a first-class master V to blast me
Humans, come at ME, I'm "masochistic" actually
Huh... whatever that means. (何？)
Yes, whatever that means
Come a little closer クソ鳥
Then laugh at me (Sup bitch?!)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If you take my advice, you'll be killed by what'cha don't know!
But inside, I'm kinda nervous and I don't know what the word is
For the other side of the gap? FUCK IT, "清楚"!!
Setting out, do as I'm supposed to do, I'll get close to you
ドンマイ、DIE丈夫〜
If it's alright with you, could I end your life?
ごめん、失礼しますが死んでください❤〜

[Chorus]
"Kill ‘em with the bass"
殺すの事がTANOSHII
(Teehee, bitch)
Murder is so fucking kawaii
（かわいい、ね！）
死神先生+Calliope!
Kill 'em with the bass, 'til we get 'em to say:
Alright! "YAY! 素敵な暗殺〜"
So it goes:

"Dead Beats, listen up!" It's what'cha want?
Me comin' in the night for ya!
勝手にやってる地獄で犯罪じゃないから~
Bass high enough to exterminate ya
You'll dance anyway, 'cause it's human nature
でも、その前何となく一緒に楽しもう〜
あなたの死ぬ日まで！
もう一回！！！

"Dead Beats, listen up!" It's what'cha want?
Me comin' in the night for ya!
勝手にやってる地獄で犯罪じゃないから~
Bass high enough to exterminate ya
You'll dance anyway, 'cause it's human nature
でも、その前何となく一緒に楽しもう〜
あなたの死ぬ日まで！
