It goes pop-pop-pop when it's coming out my asshole
And it feels good
And it feels good (It feels good!)
And it feels good
And it feels good tonight (I broke a dog's neck!)
In the darkest of times
You're there for me (I love you!)
In the darkest of times
These anal beads take care of me (They take care of me!)
Shove it up real good (Please?)
Now it kind of hurts (Ow...)
Oh, no! (There's a lot of blood!)
And I need an ambulance! (Oh my God, it's huge!)
Call the ambulance! (Someone needs to kill that thing!)
Now my ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding
Ain't nothing wrong with that
Ain't nothing wrong with that
Ain't nothing wrong with that
Ain't nothing wrong with that
My ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding
Ass is bleeding
